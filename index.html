<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I am a master's student in Statistics and Data Science at Northwestern University.
My work spans on applied statistics, machine learning, biostatistics,
and artificial intelligence. I am currently working on a large-scale collaborative
project involving 35 years of cardiovascular cohort data (CARDIA), together with
faculty in Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine and external collaborators.
I am broadly interested in methodological problems at the interface of statistics
and machine learning, and how these tools can address real-world scientific and
health-related questions.
</p>


<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<ul>
  <li>High-dimensional statistics</li>
  <li>Survival analysis</li>
  <li>Causal inference</li>
  <li>Machine learning & representation learning</li>
</ul>

<h2>Selected Projects</h2>

<h3>CARDIA Proteomics & Cardiovascular Health</h3>
<p>
I lead statistical modeling and analytical workflow development for the CARDIA 
proteomics project, which integrates 35 years of cardiovascular health data with 
over 5,000 plasma protein measurements from 5,000+ participants. My work involves 
cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of cardiovascular health scores, identifying 
six consistent protein signals through mixed-effects modeling. I also develop 
survival prediction frameworks using SIS-based screening and LASSO-penalized Cox 
models, constructing proteomic risk scores and evaluating predictive performance 
through C-index, IDI, and Kaplan–Meier methods.
