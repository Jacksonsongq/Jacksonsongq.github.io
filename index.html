<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I am a master's student in Statistics and Data Science at Northwestern University.
My work spans high-dimensional statistical learning, machine learning methods, 
biomedical data science and large-scale 
analytical workflows. I am currently working on a cohoart analysis, together with
faculty in Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine and external collaborators.
I am broadly interested in methodological problems at the interface of statistics
and machine learning, and how these tools can address real-world scientific and
health-related questions.

<h2>Selected Projects</h2>

<h3>CARDIA Proteomics & Cardiovascular Health</h3>
<p>
Currently working on statistical approaches for the CARDIA study,
a large-scale cohort with over 5,000 participants and high-dimensional proteomic data.
My work focuses on linking cardiovascular health profiles with proteomic signatures to improve prediction and understanding of long-term cardiovascular outcomes.
