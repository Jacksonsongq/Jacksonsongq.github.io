<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> My work spans high-dimensional inference, survival and determinant modeling, 
  and the application of machine-learning tools to complex data settings. 
  I am currently conducting a large-scale cohort study in collaboration with Professor Hongmei Jiang 
  and Professor Lifang Hou’s group at Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine, together with external partners.
I am broadly interested in methodological problems at the interface of statistics
and machine learning, and how these tools can address real-world scientific and
health-related questions.

<h2>Selected Projects</h2>

<h3>CARDIA Proteomics & Cardiovascular Health</h3>
<p>
Currently working on statistical approaches for the CARDIA study,
a large-scale cohort with over 5,000 participants and high-dimensional proteomic data.
My work focuses on linking cardiovascular health profiles with proteomic signatures to improve prediction and understanding of long-term cardiovascular outcomes.
</p>
Manuscript currently in preparation as part of the CARDIA Study Writing Group.
